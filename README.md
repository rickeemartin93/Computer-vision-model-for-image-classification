# Computer Vision Image Classification

This project is a basic computer vision pipeline using OpenCV and Keras to classify images.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- OpenCV
- Keras / TensorFlow
- NumPy, Matplotlib

## 🔍 Overview
The notebook includes:
- Image loading and preprocessing with OpenCV
- Building a CNN using Keras
- Training and evaluating the model
- Plotting training accuracy and loss

## 📁 Files
- `rickycvproj.ipynb`: Main notebook containing model, training, and evaluation

## 🎯 Objective
To classify images using a convolutional neural network (CNN) on a small image dataset. It demonstrates end-to-end workflow from raw data to model evaluation.

## 📊 Output
The model achieves reasonable accuracy and shows how OpenCV + Keras can be combined in a clean image classification pipeline.

## 🚀 Future Work
- Try transfer learning (e.g., MobileNetV2, ResNet50)
- Test on larger and more diverse datasets
- Improve preprocessing with augmentation
